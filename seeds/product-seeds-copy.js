Whether you're looking for a striking or glamorous look for night time, or something more subtle and natural for wearing during the day, there is a shade for everyone. They dry quickly, and depending on the depth of colour desired, can be blended in on application or left to dry before blending for a more vivid look. Layering is also possible, but however you choose to use these liquid eye shadows they won't gather in crow's feet or fine lines around the eyes. The inclusion of patented beta glucan also means they're perfect for sensitive eyes. Pale Almond is subtle, natural, and perfect for daytime wear, and compliments our Bronzed Hazel liquid eye shadow if a duo tone is desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | NULL   | cream       | eyeshadow    | //s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/001/005/original/open-uri20180630-4-1eau5wj?1530390360 |        0 |              0 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 |

We’ve created a short list of the six most important shades, with dialed-down pigment loads for a casual look: Zip, Leo, Crush, and Jam, along with the super subtle Cake and Like, which give some oomph to lighter lip tones. They’re lipsticks that adapt to you, not the other way around, so they'll appear a bit different on everyone as your natural lip color shows through. The effect? Diffused, matte goodness—just swipe it on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | NULL   | NULL        | lipstick     | //s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/999/original/open-uri20171227-4-2ul0s6?1514341420  |        0 |              0 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 |

Features:True instant colour in one stroke applicationLong wearing, easy-glide formulaNo dragSharpens with Milani’s Duo SharpenerNon-feathering formulaApplication: To outline your lips, make an X on the center of your upper lip (lip cleavage). Following the contour of your mouth, start from the outer edges of your lips and work your way towards center of your upper lip (where the x is marked). This will prevent from making one arch higher, pointier or rounder than the other.  Tip: Lipliner helps extend the wear & keeps your lipstick from feathering.   When choosing a lipliner shade, match the lipliner to your lipstick shade or match your lipliner to the shade of your lips which will work with all your lipstick shades.   Create a custom lipcolor by using a contrasting lipliner and lipstick shade.   Before applying your lipliner, pat your lips lightly with your foundation or pressed powder puff, which also helps keep you lipstick from feathering.

powder.  Gently stipple the minerals on your eye lids.   Make sure your 
skin is well hydrated so the minerals will adhere.  Try misting your 
skin with Pure Anada Marine Mineral Toner, prior to applying your 
makeup.If your shadow is prone to creasing, make sure your lids are free 
from excess oils before applying shadow.  If the problem is persistant, 
try priming your lids with Pure Anada Matte Minerals Finishing Powder or
 a coordinating Velvet Matte Shadow.
Deep shades of loose mineral shadow can be used as eyeliner.  To 
create a soft dry line, dip an angled liner brush into the powder, tap 
it off and line your eyes.  Or to create a liquid liner, wet your brush 
and dip it into the powder.  The minerals will stick to the brush.  Make
 a paste on the back of your hand, or in the lid of the jar.  Apply to 
your eyes!Ingredients: Mica,  Iron Oxides, Ultramarines, May contain: Titanium Dioxide | 4.5    | NULL        | eyeshadow    | //s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/281/original/data?1514063293                       |        0 |              0 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 |

Liquid Liner and get the control of a pencil with the intensity of a liquid eyeliner for 
beautifully defined eyes every time. The all-new paddle-shaped tip gives
 you two looks in one—thick and dramatic or thin and elegant. The 
intense black formula glides on smoothly and dries quickly for instant 
drama. Clinically tested, suitable for sensitive eyes.Directions: Stand 6 inches away from a mirror and tilt your chin up, so 
that when you look down your nose into the mirror, you can see your 
entire eyelid. Dab concealer or dust translucent powder on your upper 
lids. Blend well with a sponge or lightly pat with a fingertip to cover 
veins and prevent creasing.Before applying liner, 
determine your eye shape. If eyes are close-set or round, line only the 
outer corners. Otherwise, line the entire upper lid.Gently pull your eyelid taut at an upward angle. Beginning at the inner 
corner, draw small, connected dashes along the top lashes. Be sure to 
stay close to the roots so there is no skin visible between the lashes 
and the liner. To make eyes look bigger, extend the liner slightly 
beyond the outer corners.Use a cotton swab to fix mistakes. For larger messes, dip it in makeup remover. | NULL   | liquid      | eyeliner     | //s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/220/original/data?1514062287                       |        0 |              0 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 |

Directions: Apply a clear base coat. Start right in the centre of the nail, then apply on the two sides of the nails.  Make sure that the entire nail is covered in these 3 swipes.  Let the base coat dry completely.  Once base coat has dried apply the colour of your choice in a similar fashion: first on the centre of the nail and then on the sides.  Once dry, apply a top coat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | NULL   | NULL        | nail_polish  | //s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/167/original/data?1514062273                       |        0 |              0 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 |

Each lacquer is properly balanced with resin, plasticizer and nitrocellulose to provide a durable film that offers high gloss, exceptional wear and maximum protection for the nail.The lacquers provide durability for the ultimate in chip-free results, with each lacquer offering a carefully balanced blend of film formers that are not adversely affected when exposed to water or detergents. The formula is nonfading with lasting color fidelity over time, as the use of UV absorbers helps maintain the true colors. The lacquers maintain an excellent shelf life, with a formula that prevents pigment migration, striation, settling and syneresis over longer periods of time than most other nail enamel formulas. And, as we guarantee, the chip-resistant polishes promise superior wear and exceptional gloss retention, while helping to condition, protect, strengthen and reinforce the natural nail.                  | 5      | NULL        | nail_polish  | //s3.amazonaws.com/donovanbailey/products/api_featured_images/000/000/161/original/data?1514062272                       |        0 |              0 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 | 2021-03-21 17:53:35 |

This brand was launched in 1979 with this epic nail polish and it is one of their top-sellers. Why? Here’s what we think: not only are they just straight up awesome, but we’ve got every color, texture, and effect that you can possibly think of: creams, metallics, glitters, you name it! After decades of these flying off the shelves, they're pretty sure you already have a couple stashed away, but with so many colors, you can always add a new one – or double up! Everyone we talk to agrees—this is simply the best nail polish brand out there.Features:Purse Pride!
